This is the test case for Netlog OAuth

The problem we are encountering is that after redirecting user to the authorization page, after user clicks "Confirm" they
do not get redirected back to our site, but instead there is a message that "something has gone wrong".

This test case passes if user gets redirected back, and sees the message "If you can read this, then the bug did not occur."
