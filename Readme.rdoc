= Description

This is the test case for Netlog OAuth

The problem we are encountering is that after redirecting user to the authorization page, after user clicks "Confirm" they do not get redirected back to our site, but instead there is a message that "something has gone wrong".

This test case passes if user gets redirected back, and sees the message "If you can read this, then the bug did not occur."

= Installation

  sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems
  sudo gem install bundler
  cd /the/test/case/dir
  cp config.yml.example config.yml
  <input the right consumer keys>
  gem bundle
  ruby netlog.rb

= Running

After you run "ruby netlog.rb" go to site http://localhost:4567/ and click on the link that appears there. Follow the flow and if you finally get redirected back to localhost with message "If you can read this, then the bug did not occur." then the test passes.
